# Welcome to CSS Animation

You can choose to only make SVG and animation or integrate this assignment with your previous
Accessibility assignment. If you want animation to be a part of your Accessibility assignment,
you can copy all the codes from another file and paste it here.

PS: keep your styling simple

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone the project

2. Go to website [undraw.co](https://undraw.co/illustrations), or any free SVG open-source of
you choice. Select and download a picture to work with animation

3. Go to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/). Bring the SVG file that you have downloaded here.
Change the colors to your preferences. Decide which part to animate and rename it to be unique.
If you decide to animate serveral vectors as a group (for example: a person is a group of his head, body, arms, legs,...), you should group those vectors together, and rename the group.

4. Download the Figma design. Note: Before clicking 'Export', remember to change file type to 'SVG'
and select the option 'Include id attribute'.

5. Paste the Figma SVG file to your working folder. Coppy all the codes inside svg file to
index.html (wrap codes inside a div). Practice the animation with these features:

- rotating in different axes
- changing color
